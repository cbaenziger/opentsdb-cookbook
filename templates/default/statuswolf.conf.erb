; Anomaly detection options
; detection_lib - The anomaly detection library to use, currently only
;                 the Arugula lib is supported
; options -       Default options to pass to the detection library. For Arugula
;                 it's recommended to set CONSENSUS option. Aruguala uses five
;                 algorithms which vote on a point to be anomolous or not,
;                 CONSENSUS sets how many of those algorithms must vote yes
;                 for a data point to be flagged.

;                      associated with them will be drawn as zero
;                      instead of null (i.e. blank on the graph)
